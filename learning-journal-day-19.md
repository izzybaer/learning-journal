# Twelfth Learning Journal  
\n  
Today was the final push! All day we worked our butts off on a few minor bugs and making the CSS for every page exactly the same to tie our site together.  
\n  
In the morning we thought, oh we barely have anything to do, but of course we had a lot to do still and it took a while because, well, CSS.
\n  
We had trouble getting the site to look the same on everyones individual computer because of our screens and resolution but we finally got it all figured out and did a practice presentation run with Duncan, which went super!
\n  
We each have some lines to memorize but we are READY for tomorrow!!!  
\n  
Let's do this, presentation day.
