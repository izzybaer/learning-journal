# Tenth Learning Journal  
\n  
So today was pretty super. In the morning the first thing I did was create content for our Mission Statement and About Us on our homepage. That only took me like 10 minutes. I ACP'd it and then Evette and I started pair programming on our Resources page.  
\n  
We changed the layout of our resources page and we really like where it is now.  We added images as links, two videos, and a list of resource links that accompany each video.  
\n  
We worked a lot on CSS which took forever because CSS is a toughie. We got it to a point where we are happy with it but it does still need some finishing touches.  
\n  
Feeling pretty awesome about our project, our team, and where we are right now. It feels like we're flying through this project and getting so much done, it's awesome. All functionality is basically done and now all that's left is CSS. We still plan to create a fixed NAV bar that's on every page with a custom logo icon thingy, and a fixed footer on every page with a small logo icon thingy and contact info.  
\n  
Ready for tomorrow!!!
