OMG ITS FRIDAY OF OUR SECOND WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!  
\n  
IM SO EXCITED AND I JUST CANT HIDE IT!!!!!!!!!
\n  
Okay so today's lab was tough. Some of it was pretty simple, but some of it was not. Which is clearly how it was supposed to be because today was our first real interaction with .map .reduce and .filter. I definitely didn't use these at all in 201, so I wasn't totally clear on how they worked and things can get pretty complex with huge amounts of data.
\n  
We only struggled a bit with a few of the new Article functions - numWordsAll, allAuthors, and numWordsAllAuthors. numWordsAllAuthors was kinda tricky. And I still don't totally get what we did or why it works, it is a little fuzzy still. I kinda do. But I also kinda don't.

Anyways, its Friday and I'm ti ti. SO I'm going home to enjoy my weekend. or try to.
\n  
BYEEEEEEE!!!!!!
