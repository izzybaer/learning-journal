# Fourth Learning Journal

So today we talked about the DOM which we read about this weekend, or whenever, before class. The DOM seems to be something that can be very useful and helpful, and even really cool, if you can actually understand it. It is also very complex and hard to understand.

Most of my time in lab today was spent trying to create methods to calculate results, and trying to loop through hours in a day. Then, what took me even longer it felt like, was trying to use the DOM and create 'li' tags in my html, through js. That was definitely a hard concept to grasp. I already know how to create these things in html and style them in CSS so I guess I felt like, why do I need this? I'm sure soon enough I'll see why its necessary.

Once I realized that all I had to do today (ha ha ha, 'all') was app.js and sales.html and get that unordered list to appear on the page, I was relieved because adding CSS at that point (830pm) was not something I could come to terms with. I am so drained and exhausted and it's only Monday.

At the end of everyday I can barely find the time to shove some nutrient dense food inside my face hole, shower, and finish my homework. AND get to sleep at a reasonable hour, which is 11 for me.
