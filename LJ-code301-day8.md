# Fifth Learning Journal
\n
This week we have been working with Node JS and today we started using postgres SQL.
\n
I don't really understand what it is completely yet. But today we had a relatively easy time with our lab, downloading packages to our packages.json and understanding how SQL works. After last nights SQL Bolt reading I think I kind of get the hang of it, its just a matter of getting the syntax down and memorized because SQL uses very specific quotes and syntax.
\n
That being said I still don't totally know what I'm doing. Monday's lab was pretty tough for me, using JSON to store data in local storage. When we finally wrote the correct code, everything worked and it was great, but I still don't know what I did or even get what I did. I guess it will just take time.
\n
I'm positive. Anything is possible, with life and with coding. Anything you can imagine, is possible. Right now all I can think about is that I have to go to the doctor by 530pm, be in Fremont at a prior commitment at 7pm somehow, and be there til 10pm or later, AND I WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO WATCH THE NEW ANNE OF GREEN GABLES ON NETFLIX.
