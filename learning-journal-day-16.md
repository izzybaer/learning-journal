# Tenth Learning Journal
\n  
Wow, we are in our last week. It's crazy and I can't even believe it.  
\n  
I didn't know what project week would be like, and so far I've only experienced the first day, Monday. It's definitely been super helpful to have four brains working on this project at a time vs. one, it's made things go a lot smoother and faster. When one of us is struggling or has a bug, everyone comes together to look over the code, test it, and problem solve solutions.

I really love my group and combined their talents are immeasurable, I'm definitely blown away by everyones abilities after 3 short intense weeks. I know what Dustin is good at, I know what Matthew is good at, I kind of know what Evette is good at, and I have no idea what I am good at. I mostly know what I am not good at, or what I don't yet feel totally comfortable with. JavaScript, the DOM, appending elements to the page and to other elements.

I'm ready to tackle the rest of this week, but for right now I'm ready to tackle today, Tuesday.
