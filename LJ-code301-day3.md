# Second Learning Journal

DOOOOOOOOD!

Today was nuts. What we did in lab was really tough and I actually wish I could keep doing it over and over again everyday until I actually completely understand. It seems like a trend for me in class, 201 and now 301, is that I never totally get what I'm doing and learning. I kinda get it. Which is better than nothing I guess. I just want to get stuff, for everything to click.

Having two lab assignments everyday is a lot to handle. Pair programming makes things go faster but still... its a lot. I just got home. It's 9pm and I still have to read. But I'm still excited for tomorrow!

Coding is hard and frustrating and challenging, and rewarding and fun :)
