# Fourth Learning Journal

Ummm.... so yeah. Today was super tough. Lecture was all fine and great but lab.... I made the code work some how and I typed the things but I have no idea what I did or how I did it, or what it does.

At this point I'm getting used to that feeling of having no idea what I'm doing or how I'm doing it or why it works. It's kinda weird and I definitely would prefer "understanding" but I'll take what I can get. Tomorrow is a new day and I have more work to do on my portfolio!
