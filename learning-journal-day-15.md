# Ninth Learning Journal

Today officially marks 3 weeks in 201. Wow. I am blown away by all of the knowledge I've been exposed to. At this point, I'm just really hoping I actually get it and retain it, and can use it.
\n  
Now that I know that I can do anything as long as I have grit, I know I will be successful no matter the obstacles I am faced with. I am feeling happy and grateful, drained and exhausted, and above all else, hopeful.

Today was awesome because we got to pitch our final project ideas and mine actually got chosen! I'm so excited that I get to build a website with talented people, dedicated to rescuing and helping goats! :)
