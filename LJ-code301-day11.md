Today.... was interesting.
\n  
We worked even more closely with MVC, and pages.js and especially the controller. So instead of having one chunk of code now that handles everything, we now have a controller.js for each of our tabs, or "pages". I don't really see the point in this. I like changing the url at the top of the page but the rest I don't quite get.

Anyways now I'm at a meet-up and I have to go meet someone....
