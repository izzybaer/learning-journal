# First Learning Journal  
\n
Today was full of a lot of new information. We were given an outline of how things are gonna go in the next four weeks. This class is already very very different from 201 which is great, but also strange, and going to take a bit of getting used to.

I really like pair program assignments and feel as though most of the time this way of working on our labs is faster than working by yourself. Rarely is it the case that things move more slowly during pair programming assignments.

I got paired with Matthew and I really like working with him, we work well together. I am excited to be paired with a different person everyday and learn about my classmates, their coding and workflow styles, and see what and who I work best with.

Today I am tired and ready to go home and do my reading, and maybe some extra credit, maybe some code wars, and some rest.
