# Eleventh Learning Journal  
\n  
Today was awesome! We got soooo much done! We finished the home page, the fixed nav/header bar for every page, and the fixed footer for every page. We put those on every single page besides home and have some CSS tweaking to do tomorrow but that's it. Everything else is done. Minor tweaks are all that is left.  
\n  
I am really excited because all that's left is tomorrows final touches and then we get to present on Friday! This has been such an amazing experience and I've learned so much. I've loved every minute of this final project week.

Things are really easy when you get to work with talented, motivated, really smart and positive people. That makes all the difference in a days work.
