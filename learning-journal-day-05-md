# Third Learning Journal
\n
Today, again, was SUPER TOUGH. Functions = hard and scary. For loops = hard and scary. Arrays = hard and scary. Everything is hard and I am scared.
\n
Functions themselves are tough alone, then put a function inside a function, and my mind is so blown. I want to get this SO BAD. SO BAD. But it feels like my brain is going 'does not compute.'
\n
I just want to learn the things and understand the things and retain the things. Then be able to use the things!!!!!

TGIF, dude.
