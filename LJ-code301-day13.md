# Eighth Learning Journal
\n  
Today was our Heroku deployment which wasn't super super hard but was tricky because we had to add our database_url to our const conString before our conString.
\n  
For a while I couldn't figure out why nothing was working and I finally went and asked Gio for help, luckily we figured it out and then I was able to help some others as well.
\n  
Today marks 3 entire days since I have smoked a cigarette, and also today we got our groups for our final projects. ANOTHER ALSO - I deleted all my code that I submitted for yesterdays portfolio12 assignment because I decided I didn't want to display my repos and then come to find out, of course, we need that code to deploy our heroku apps today. So I had to redo everything I un did and everything I did yesterday. Very frustrating.

Initially not thrilled with my group. I've spoken to Justin only a little bit, and literally like 3 words to Timothy. I took 201 with both of them and now have almost been with both of them in 301 for 3 weeks. That's 8 weeks I've known them and have never even spoken to them. Not to mention there are only three people in our group, so we are going to have a bigger workload than groups of four.
\n  
All in all, not the best day. Really trying to stay positive about my group. And life....
