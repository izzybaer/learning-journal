# Third Learning Journal  
\n
Well, template literals are hard. I used them in my assignments this week and I don't quite understand how they work yet which makes me feel a little weird. I keep learning new stuff each day and then using it in lab once and then building on it the next day when I still don't quite get it. I guess that's the point, still tough.   
\n  
I struggle with always feeling like I'm not getting what we're doing, and wondering if I'm the only one who feels this way. But I don't think I am, I think this is tough stuff and everyone else is just trying to get it like I am.

Unfortunately I did not get to the weekend with most of my work finished so I have a lot to do this weekend, which is partially understandable and partially annoying.

Oh well, Happy Weekend!er
