# Second Learning Journal

Today was really tough for me. Arrays, for loops, while loops, and conditions are proving to be very tough for me. I'm not sure if it's the logic part of what, but my brain has trouble comprehending this stuff.
\n
During lab today, I struggled HARD. I needed a TA for most of the lab, and that made me feel really dumb. I was constantly not understanding and just not getting how things were being explained to me. I know that everyone learns differently, and maybe I don't learn as well as the general public.
\n
I'm really hoping I learned some things in lab today, quite a few things actually, and that I am able to retain them and use them.
\n
I can't wait for tomorrow!
