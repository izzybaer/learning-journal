# Second Learning Journal

I love this class so much. Every single minute I learn something new and incredible. Technology is so incredible. Today we talked more about the terminal and Git vs Github, and can safely say I definitely feel more confident about using them.

Before I started this class, I was worried. I thought that I wasn't smart enough to be a programmer, and that I would not be successful. But yesterday when I ran the code for my first coding homework assignment, and it worked, man something just clicked. I was like, oh my gosh, you ARE smart enough to be a programmer, and you CAN do this. Your success is in your control.
\n
I love learning and being challenged, and in the tech industry I'm going to be learning something new everyday for the rest of my life. How many people can say that about their careers? I feel so lucky and so happy to be here. I know that if I give this everything I've got, there's no way that I can fail.

Specifically in lab today, I sat across from Matt, and he helped me to push my work to Github, because I didn't quite remember how. He was super helpful and kind, and really knew what he was doing. I'm glad for the opportunity to learn from others who are in the same position I am.
\n
I hope that for the rest of this class I continue to have the level of enthusiasm and hope I have today. I can't wait!
