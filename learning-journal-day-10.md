This week was freakin nuts. I thought that Tuesday was going to be the toughest day of the week. And it definitely was, until today.

CSS is way harder than it seems. We did pair-programming which can be really great or really awful depending on your partner. I didn't realize that partners were chosen randomly. I thought that you guys paired people with different strengths and different weaknesses together, because that makes sense right?

Anyways, Michael was my partner and he was pretty tired and braindead today. He was very chatty and off topic which distracted me and I felt like I couldn't get a lot done. To be fair, we also chose the worst possible way to pair-program and definitely won't be making that mistake again.

Oh and one more thing, chocolate pizza is super uncool. Not tasty.
