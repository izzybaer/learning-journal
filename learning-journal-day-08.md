Oh my my my, my my. THIS WEEK. WOAH.
\n
Every single day this week in lecture I feel like Duncan is taking a leaf blower to a pile of leaves and I'm on the other side of the pile trying to catch leaves like they're diamonds. Is that weird?

Anyways, today actually went a lot better than I thought it would. In lecture I was having trouble with everything he was saying but in lab, after talking through some things with him in detail, and bouncing things off Michael and Liz, I kinda got stuff. Sorta. I mean maybe I got it enough to just finish the assignment for the day but maybe I got it even more. I'm not sure.

I am excited to do more CSS with my page!!!!
