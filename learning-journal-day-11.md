Today was really rough for me. I felt like the entirety of what we did last week was shoved into todays assignment and we were told 'okay now go do everything you did over a period of five days in less than 24 hours'. That was hard for me.

I thought last week was supposed to be the hardest week. But today was pretty hard also.

I did what I could do today. Tomorrow is a new day.
