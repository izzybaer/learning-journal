# Ninth Learning Journal
\n  
Friday went really well. Our group got together and laid out our project proposal, problem domain, domain models and wireframes. Then we created a repo on GitHub with a project and made several to-do lists in there. We finished outlining our github procedures, and decided to pair program as much as we can with one driver and two navigators.
\n  
We did a lot of research on our API's and the TA's told us we could only have one API which was strange because I talked to several of my classmates who are all using more than one. So I've decided we are going to use GoogleMaps JavaScript API with its Google Places library, as well as Foursquare API to filter by checkins and popularity of places and activities.
\n  
We are all three coming into school on Monday morning for a few hours to start and finish our MVP, get our API's working and get the form and functionality finished. Overall I think this is going to be a really fun project. I'm excited!
